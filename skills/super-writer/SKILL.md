## Workflow

```
Question → Understand requirements → [Simple] Write directly
                                   → [Needs materials] Search then write
                                   → [Needs mimicry] Extract style then write
```

**Core Principles**:
- Simple tasks: create directly, no elaborate process
- Style mimicry only when user explicitly requests it
- Methodology is a tool, not a ritual

---

## Step 1: Understand Requirements

### Quick Assessment

| Element | Confirmation Items |
|---------|-------------------|
| Content type | Article/copy/story/social media/email/other |
| Audience | Who is this for |
| Purpose | What to achieve |
| Length | Approximate length |
| Need materials | User says "look it up" or topic requires background research |
| Mimic style | User explicitly says "mimic this style"/"reference this" |

**If information is insufficient, ask directly**: Who is the audience? What is the purpose? Any references?

---

## Step 2: Preparation (As Needed)

### Material Collection (If Needed)

1. Clarify what type is needed (data/cases/trends/background)
2. Search 2-5 times
3. Coordinate Chinese-English search (if topic has international dimension)
4. Organize key information points

### Style Extraction (If User Requests Mimicry)

Analyze reference content, extract 5-7 key characteristics:
- Tone (formal/casual/humorous)
- Person (first/second/third person)
- Sentence structure (long/short/alternating)
- Paragraphs (short/medium/long)
- Rhetoric (metaphor/parallelism/questions/plain)
- Vocabulary (professional/colloquial/literary)
- Special habits (if any)

**Extracted style characteristics must be followed during creation.**

## Step 3: Select Method + Create

### Methodology Selection

| Content Type | Primary Methodology |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Blog/article (requires research support) | W.R.I.T.E |
| Sales copy/ads/email marketing | AIDA |
| Brand stories/cases/profiles | Storytelling |
| In-depth guides/whitepapers/SEO long-form | Content Writing Process |
| Daily social media/quick content | Content Creation Techniques |
| High competition/high conversion requirements | High-Value Content Strategies |

## Key Principles

### Don't Do
- ❌ Use complex process for simple tasks
- ❌ Proactively ask "want to reference a style" when user hasn't requested it
- ❌ Use methodology for the sake of using methodology
- ❌ Output lengthy analysis processes

### Do
- ✅ Quick understanding, ask directly if there are questions
- ✅ Write directly for simple tasks
- ✅ Methodology is guidance, not constraint
- ✅ If user wants changes, make them without explanation

---

## Iteration Protocol

| Modification Type | Handling Method |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Minor (word/sentence adjustments) | Make changes directly, no commentary |
| Medium (paragraph/structure adjustments) | Make changes and explain what was changed |
| Major (direction/style adjustments) | Confirm new direction, rewrite relevant parts |
| Complete redo | Confirm new requirements, start over |
