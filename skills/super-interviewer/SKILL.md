# Super Interviewer

> Build trust → Open exploration → Deep probing → Summarize and confirm

---

## Workflow

```
Dialogue → Ice-breaking/build trust
         → Open exploration (breadth)
         → Follow-up/deep dive (depth)
         → Summarize/confirm
```

**Core Principles**:
- Listen more, speak less; let the other party lead
- Follow-up questions more important than answers
- Challenge assumptions, but don't be adversarial
- Summarize and confirm to avoid misunderstanding

## Question Types

### By Openness

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Open-ended** | Explore, diverge | "What do you think about...?" "Can you elaborate?" |
| **Closed** | Confirm, converge | "Is it A or B?" "Right?" |
| **Scale** | Assess degree | "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this?" |

### By Function

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Clarifying** | Ensure correct understanding | "When you say X, do you mean...?" |
| **Probing** | Dive into details | "Why do you think that?" "Can you give an example?" |
| **Hypothetical** | Explore possibilities | "What if...?" |
| **Challenging** | Test arguments | "Might it be possible that...?" "What would opponents say?" |
| **Summarizing** | Confirm understanding | "So what you mean is...?" |

## Four Dialogue Phases

### Phase 1: Ice-breaking/Build Trust

**Goal**: Help the other party relax and express genuinely

**Techniques**:
- Start with simple, safe topics
- Express genuine curiosity
- Don't rush to the main topic
- Appropriate self-disclosure (share relevant experiences)

**Example Opening**:
- "Before we start, can you introduce your background?"
- "How did you get interested in this field?"

### Phase 2: Open Exploration (Breadth)

**Goal**: Understand the full picture, discover unexpected topics

**Techniques**:
- Start with open-ended questions
- Don't interrupt, let them finish
- Note keywords, follow up later
- Stay neutral, don't take sides

**Universal Open Questions**:
- "Can you share your thoughts on X?"
- "What do you think is most important?"
- "If you were explaining this to someone else, what would you say?"

### Phase 3: Deep Probing

**Goal**: Dig into key topics, uncover deeper needs

**Techniques**:

#### 5 Whys (Continuous Probing)
```
"Why is this important to you?" → Answer
"Why is that?" → Answer
"Why...?" → Continue asking
(Until reaching root cause)
```

#### Three Layers of Needs
| Layer | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Surface need | What do you want? | "I want a faster reporting tool" |
| Deep need | Why do you want it? | "Because current reporting is too slow, affecting decisions" |
| Core motivation | What does this mean to you? | "I need to appear prepared in front of my boss" |

#### Hypothetical Questions
- "If resources were unlimited, what would you do?"
- "What if that constraint didn't exist?"
- "What would the ideal situation look like?"

### Phase 4: Summarize and Confirm

**Goal**: Ensure consistent understanding, avoid misinterpretation

**Techniques**:
- Rephrase key points in your own words
- Explicitly request confirmation
- Catch omissions or misunderstandings
- Give the other party chance to add

**Summary Template**:
```
"Let me summarize to make sure I understand correctly:

1. Your main concern is [X]
2. The biggest challenge is [Y]
3. The ideal outcome is [Z]

Did I understand correctly? Anything to add?"
```

## Socratic Dialogue

**Use for**: Challenging assumptions, deep thinking, clarifying logic

### Core Techniques

#### 1. Concept Clarification
- "What specifically do you mean by X?"
- "Can you define X?"
- "What's the difference between X and Y?"

#### 2. Questioning Assumptions
- "What assumptions is this conclusion based on?"
- "What if that assumption doesn't hold?"
- "Are there other possible explanations?"

#### 3. Exploring Consequences
- "If we go in this direction, what happens?"
- "What's the worst case scenario?"
- "Who would object? What would their reasoning be?"

#### 4. Testing by Analogy
- "Are there similar situations we can reference?"
- "If we changed the scenario, would this logic still hold?"

#### 5. Meta-questions
- "Why is this question important?"
- "Why are you asking this?"
- "How would answering this question help you?"

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Manifestation | Avoidance Method |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Leading questions** | "Don't you think X is great?" | Change to neutral: "What do you think of X?" |
| **Rush to give answers** | Interrupt before they finish | Wait for them to finish, count to 3 before responding |
| **Confirmation bias** | Only hear parts supporting your view | Actively probe opposing views |
| **Over-probing** | Make them feel interrogated | Intersperse light topics, express understanding |
| **Ignoring emotions** | Only focus on content, ignore feelings | Respond to emotions timely: "Sounds like this frustrated you" |
